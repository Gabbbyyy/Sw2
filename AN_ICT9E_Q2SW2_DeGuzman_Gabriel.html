			<td class="td2"><p>The Samoyed is a medium-sized dog, ranging in size from 19 to 23 1/2 inches in height and 50 to 65 pounds in weight (23 to 29 kilograms). Samoyeds are solidly built, strong dogs with a plumed, curled tail that is draped over the back and to one side. The skull is large and the ears are pointed.</p></td>

			<td class="td2"><p>Many diseases and health concerns are inherited, which means they are linked to the breed of your pet. There is a consensus among canine geneticists and veterinarians that the disorders discussed in this article have a considerable occurrence rate and/or impact in this breed. This merely indicates that your dog is at a greater risk for developing these issues than other dogs. We will outline the most prevalent issues observed in Samoyeds in order to give you an idea of what your dog may face in the future. Obviously, we cannot cover every option here; thus, if you observe any strange indications or symptoms, please contact us immediately.</p></td>

			<td class="td2"><p>The Samoyed is a sociable and friendly dog. These are bright, somewhat independent canines. Bred to live in a tent with their families in close quarters, they thrive on human companionship. Samoyeds are capable of producing an alarm bark and, if left alone for extended periods of time, frequently evolve into nuisance barkers. They dig in order to reach a cool resting location, which can be a concern.</p></td>

			<td class="td2"><p>Daily exercise for the Samoyed consists of a long walk or climb coupled with active play. It enjoys running and exploring, so it requires a safe location, such as a yard with a secure fence. The dog also enjoys sledding and other weight-pulling activities, and it can successfully compete in agility, obedience, and nose-work contests. In general, Samoyeds are not enthusiastic swimmers. The breed is adapted to cold areas, and its thick undercoat can lead to overheating in warmer climates. If the undercoat is not brushed down to the skin two to three times each week, serious matting is likely to form (and as often as daily during shedding seasons, the heaviest of which occurs in the spring). When severe matting occurs, the affected region may need to be shaved by a professional. As with other large dog breeds prone to developing hip dysplasia, Samoyed puppies should consume a large-breed puppy food formulated to limit their growth rate, so reducing their likelihood of getting the disorder.</p></td>

			<td class="td2"><p>The Samoyed is truly an ancient breed, selected by nomadic tribes in Siberia to herd their reindeer and double as sled pullers when needed. Originally, these all-purpose dogs were of a variety of colors, but the sparkling white has since taken over in most areas of the world. The Soviet Nenet Herding Laika may be the true ancestor of the Samoyed we know.</p></td>
